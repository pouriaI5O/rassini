Shapiro-Wilk Test:

Statistic: 0.9850479960441589
p-value: 0.32012972235679626
Interpretation: The Shapiro-Wilk test is used to assess the normality of the data. In this case, the Shapiro-Wilk test statistic is 0.985, and the p-value is 0.320. Since the p-value (0.320) is greater than the significance level of 0.05 (assuming an alpha level of 0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we can conclude that the data is normally distributed.
Anderson-Darling Test:

Statistic: 0.49566189837736374
Critical Values: [0.555 0.632 0.759 0.885 1.053]
Significance Levels: [15. 10. 5. 2.5 1. ]
Interpretation: The Anderson-Darling test is another test for normality. The test statistic here is 0.496. To determine whether the data is normally distributed, we compare the test statistic to the critical values at different significance levels. In this case, the test statistic is smaller than the critical values at all significance levels, indicating that the data is normally distributed.
Standard Processing Time: 125.74257731958764

Interpretation: After removing the outliers and performing the necessary statistical analysis, the calculated standard processing time is 125.74 seconds.
Based on the results, it appears that the processing time data is normally distributed, and the calculated standard processing time is 125.74 seconds.
